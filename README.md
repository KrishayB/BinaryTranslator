# BinaryTranslator

As the title says, this is a translator for binary made with Java

### How to start it:
Run the file, and enter some binary in the terminal. For example, "01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111" (Without the quotes). Then, just wait for it to translate and give a response. This project is a littele buggy, and it may not work if you enter these characters without the spaces.
